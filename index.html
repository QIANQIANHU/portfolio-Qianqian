        <h4>My story</h4>
        <p>As a female from finance background, I started my career as an <span class="special">auditor</span> at KPMG in China. It was a really great jump start of my career: immersed in the environment of data and busy schedule, the requirements to understand various new domain knowledge very quickly, and strong teamwork dependency, through the years, I trained myself to become a quick learner and a professional who employs analytical skills and data-driven approaches naturally when facing new problems.</p>
        <p>In 2014, I left the job at Nanjing, China, and immigrated to Seattle, I took a <span class="special">product manager</span> role at an early stage startup Pindous Coffee. This was a company founded by a group of engineers, and the concept was to combine technology with the traditional coffee business to introduce Seattle specialty coffees to the emerging Chinese market. I kept very close interactions with developers and designers of the team, and was really attracted by the fascinating stuff they are working on. Their workflow is strict and logic but also really dynamic and creative. This was the first time that I realized it exists such a role that could convert an idea to realities so quickly and smoothly, and one that could combine logic and passion so closely. That is the kind of role that I was hoping for long.</p>

        <p>In 2016, I left the job at the startup and became a mother later of that year. Since I realized that I am interested in programming via my previous startup experience, why not give it a deep diving to understand if this is truly the direction of next stage of my career. So I asked around the programmer friends what exactly inspires them to become a developer. The most frequent answer I received is to implement one's own idea to reality in order to impact the world. Yes, it sounds like me: I am the kind of person who is very alive to what happened around me, always thinking how we could seek the better for the status quo. I realized that I want to have similar experience in my everyday professional life, and thus becoming a full-time programmer is my decision of the next step of my career.</p>

        <p>Currently, I am most interested in the <span class="special">front-end</span> and have done some development work, although, someone may argue that front-end is tedious and too much detailed work, but I think it is a similar process as how you build a house: each exterior building block is trivial, but the overall built-up house is so beautiful. I hope I can extend my learning to <span class="special">full-stack</span> development. Similar to the house building analog, I'm interested in every portion of the process, from the concrete base to the final decoration part. I want to collaborate with others, become an engaging member of the project and solve problems together to reach a common goal.</p>
